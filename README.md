This is a movie website developed using Next.js, utilizing the themoviedb.org APIs to fetch movie data and provide users with movie details, and other movie-related information. In this project, I modularized the API services and kept the code clean and organized.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
